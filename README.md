## Instructions for Students

1. Clone this repository to begin working.
2. If you have XCode and wish to work with XCode, please use the `xcode` folder.
   Otherwise, please use the `swift` folder (e.g. when working with Swift on
   Linux).
3. Once you are done, ping the tutor to get reviews/comments.

## Tips

1. CS3217's docs is at https://cs3217.netlify.com. Do visit the docs often, as
   it contains all things relevant to CS3217.
2. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you
   to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. We opted in all rules and
   then slowly removed some rules we found unwieldy; as such, if you discover
   any rule that you think should be added/removed, do notify the teaching staff
   and we will consider changing it!

   In addition, keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline;
   some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
3. Do not burn out. Have fun!
